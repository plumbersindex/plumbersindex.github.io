<p>The nationwide average cost to repair a dripping faucet is $65-$ 150, however the cost may be higher, depending upon the nature and cause of the leak. Typical water heater problems include cold or tepid water, a leaking tank or scalding water. The cause of these issues can be hard to identify, so it is very important to work with a professional plumbing contractor who is familiar with the knowledge needed to locate the issue and make the appropriate repairs.</p>
<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a various design from the one we show, check the instructions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>

Failing to repair a running toilet can result in squandered water and a very high water bill. Water in Florida is expensive so don't postpone-- get a running toilet repaired. Repairing it may be best if your water heater is only a few years old and just has a small issue. If the cost of changing damaged parts is low-cost, you might wish to consider repairing your hot water heater and scheduling regular maintenance.</p>
<p>Tankless water heating units are becoming more popular due to the high-end of endless warm water and area conserving applications. While they are more pricey to install, they offer numerous benefits house owners are looking for when changing a hot water heater such as their increased energy performance. If the old and inefficient water heater is leaking and needs replaced, it is a great time to speak to the experts and see if tankless hot water heaters are right for you.</p>
