At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
