<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high danger" facilities.</p>
