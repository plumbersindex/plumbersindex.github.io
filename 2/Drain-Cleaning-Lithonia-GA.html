New meters should satisfy regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas suppliers may require an unique meter for their services, limiting your choices. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number listed on the building authorization. Inspections ought to be made after foundation excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon conclusion. NOTE: If malfunctioning work is discovered, the inspector will release a violation notice, and a specific period of time is allocated to remedy the problem.</p>
