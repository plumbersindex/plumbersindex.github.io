<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily kept for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
