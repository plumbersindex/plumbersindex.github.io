<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Mcdonough GA</h3>
<p>If  you're tired of dealing with the side-effects of difficult water, a water softening system from RainSoft can provide you with the service you need. Ever since we initially opened in 1953, our water softeners have made a distinction in the lives of countless homeowners in The United States and Canada and around the globe. Our premium system, the EC4 whole house water softener, is a state-of-the-art item that uses a procedure of ion exchange to get rid of the minerals that trigger tough water. By replacing the calcium, bicarbonate, and magnesium ions that cause water hardness with sodium or potassium ions, the EC4 softens tough water by resolving its source. Moreover, thanks to its distinct, built-in microprocessor, the EC4 system will discover your common water usage patterns, changing its soft water delivery based upon your needs. In this method, our premium water softener guarantees that you'll have an unrestricted supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these signs.</p>
