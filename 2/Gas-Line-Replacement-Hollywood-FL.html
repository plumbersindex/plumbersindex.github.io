<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Hollywood FL</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
