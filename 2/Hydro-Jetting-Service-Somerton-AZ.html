You might wind up doing more harm than great if you continue to fight with it, which can create long-term problems. If you do not have an expert appearance into your clog circumstance, sewage back-flow is another major concern.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be).
