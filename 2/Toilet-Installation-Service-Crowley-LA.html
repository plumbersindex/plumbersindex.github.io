<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Crowley LA</h3>

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
