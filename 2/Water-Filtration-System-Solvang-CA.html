<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
