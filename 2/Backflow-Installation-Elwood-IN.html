Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. But discovering the right washer might not be. The most common washers are often available at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be hard to find.
