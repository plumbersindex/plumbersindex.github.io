<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to leave.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
