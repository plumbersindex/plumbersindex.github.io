<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.
