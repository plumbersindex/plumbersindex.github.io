<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Hard water, particles from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing completely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris. Photos 1 and 2 reveal you how to do this on one typical kind of valve. Even though other valves will look various, the clearing procedure is similar. However, you may need to eliminate a couple of screws on top of the fill valve to eliminate the cap.</p>
