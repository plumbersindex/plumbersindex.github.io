<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it hard to get to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big task, changing exposed pipes in a basement, energy, or crawlspace  room is relatively simple, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets should definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet must be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
