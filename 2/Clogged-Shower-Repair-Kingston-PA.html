<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house.

If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). Inspect the instructions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
