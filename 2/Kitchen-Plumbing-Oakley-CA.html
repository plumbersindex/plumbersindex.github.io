In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane.

Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to remove any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
