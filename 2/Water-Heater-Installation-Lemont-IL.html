<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Lemont IL</h3>
<p>We aren't here to sway you in one direction or the other - we install both gas and electric water heaters - but we want to educate you on the advantages and downsides of both so you can make the option that best fits you. This is particularly common after returning from a holiday or not using your house's water system for an extended amount of time. If this occurs just when your hot water is running, it might be because of a corroded warm water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your house.</p>

Baffles: Baffles prevent flatware from getting in the garbage disposal, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
