<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent to drain. This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
