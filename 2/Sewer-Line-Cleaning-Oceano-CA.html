Other benefits you will see include brighter colors in your clothing, minimized scale build-up on your showers and softer skin. For a cutoff switch where the backflow preventer is located downstream of the booster pump( s) - set at 20 psi.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
