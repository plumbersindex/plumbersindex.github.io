For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or lower pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
