When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated effectively. If the bypass valve is broken, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed over time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal might likewise be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration procedures. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely broken and just needs to be changed.</p>
