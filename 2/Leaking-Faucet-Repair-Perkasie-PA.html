<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style).

This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
