<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Brunswick GA</h3>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair costs may remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater. To make sure that we are supplying high-quality work and client peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to safely carry out hot water heater replacements. In addition to traditional hot water heater, we likewise install tankless hot water heater, and heatpump water heaters.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
