<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to access to in-wall pipes, consider at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets should absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet needs to be replaced. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>

CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) is one of the most common kinds of plastic piping used in plumbing systems today.
