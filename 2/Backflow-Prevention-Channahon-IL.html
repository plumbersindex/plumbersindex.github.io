<p>No hot water - The most apparent indicator that your hot water heater is malfunctioning is an absence of hot water originating from the tap.

Not only is an absence of hot water a big annoyance, but it might also result in greater gas or electrical expenses since your unit is most likely utilizing more energy to work with a reduced performance.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two indications of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet.
