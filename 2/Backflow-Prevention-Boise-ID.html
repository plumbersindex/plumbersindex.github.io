<p>Finally, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
