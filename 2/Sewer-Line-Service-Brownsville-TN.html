<p>Leaks are sly. While the time required will differ based upon your house size and the number of found malfunctions, it's best to set aside approximately two hours when you arrange an inspection. There's constantly the chance that your plumber's previous task will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the job (unless you have a very small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to arrange your visit.</p>
