<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair bill might remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater. To ensure that we are offering high-quality work and customer peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to securely carry out hot water heater replacements. In addition to conventional water heaters, we likewise install tankless hot water heater, and heat pump water heaters.</p>
<p>Faulty parts: If you have an electric water heater, a malfunctioning thermostat or a tripped breaker can trigger problems. If you have a gas system, the pilot light might head out, resulting in little or no hot water. In general, conventional water heaters are anticipated to last 7-10 years with proper maintenance. If you're moving into a brand-new house, check the age of the existing water heater. You do not want to move into a brand-new home just to find out you're going to have to make a significant plumbing repair in simply a year or 2.</p>
