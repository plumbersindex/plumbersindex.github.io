Numerous obstructions are caused by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl. Be aware of how much bathroom tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never place any paper item into the toilet bowl other than bathroom tissue. Paper towels can rapidly block the toilet drain line or cause a clog even more down the drain. Feminine hygiene items ought to be gotten rid of in the garbage and never ever in the toilet.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
