<p>An rdc is similar to a DC because it is a mechanical backflow preventer including two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves. Nevertheless, it normally does not include shutoff valves, may or might not be geared up with test dicks or ports, and is usually less reliable than a DC. An rdc is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but should be utilized to isolate just nonhealth dangers and is planned for usage only in water service connections to single-family homes.</p>
