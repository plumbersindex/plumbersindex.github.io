<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5). Check the instructions if your valve is a different design from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
