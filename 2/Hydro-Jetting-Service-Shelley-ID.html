<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Dual flush valves are becoming more and more typical, as both makers and consumers look for new ways to conserve water. Double flush toilets permit the user to choose the level of water needed to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is solid or liquid.
