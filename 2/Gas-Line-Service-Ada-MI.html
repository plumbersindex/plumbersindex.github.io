<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of desired uses around your house.</p>
<p>Lubrication may assist with the positioning of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not assist the assembly work any better, it is just there to help the service technician put together the components into the body without creating damage from friction. The lubricant needs to be a food grade lube to ensure the water system is not contaminated. In a lot of cases the best lube is water. The typical usage for lubricant in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently lubricated to ensure they do not roll out of their retainer. Making use of too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to wear or fail out faster by drawing in dirt and particles or limiting the movement of the part. The appropriate amount of lubricant should make the surface area of the 'ring appear damp. You ought to never see chunks or globs of lubricant.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for performing yearly forward flow tests are often viewed as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to just connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist. Recent Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant shown up during the designated period. They disconnected the sinks, tidied up and suggested a tool to be used in the future.</p>
