<p>The waste disposal unit is humming, however not turning. The garbage disposal has ended up being jammed. NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL if IT IS JAMMED. Even if the unit is off, the blades are dangerous and sharp. Make sure the system is off, you can even shut off the breaker to make sure it can't be turned on by accident. Your garbage disposal includes a. hex wrench that can be used to insert into the opening located at the bottom of the system. If you can't find this wrench, then try to insert a broom plunger or handle into the sink drain opening and attempt to turn the jammed flywheel. If it seems to be moving freely turn the system back on (and don't forget to turn back on the circuit breaker if you don't it off) and see if the system is working.</p>
