<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of utilize the method laid out above. Since the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free.
