<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high end of the irrigated area. It might not be installed in any area where it might ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not permit the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't allow the usage of a PVB at all, so consult your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer might spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow takes place, so it should be set up in an area where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
