<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
