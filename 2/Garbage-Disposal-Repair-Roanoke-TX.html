<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct effect on your security, benefit, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. Your water is brown or red. Some kinds of pipes can rust with time. This rust will break off into your house's water supply and can turn your tap water a reddish or brown  color.
