<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for producing a safe water system system. A malfunctioning garbage disposal, grease buildup, collected food and more can all contribute to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems. There are a number of methods homeowners can unclog a kitchen sink, including using a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or using a solution of vinegar and baking soda.
