<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water flow. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to escape. Sometimes no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
