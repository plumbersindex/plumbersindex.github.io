<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Newnan GA</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and removed. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to remove any leftover contaminants.</p>
<p>Copper is a strong product that will not come down with large-scale corrosion and complete pipe failure. That's why it's the trusted metal for pipe replacement these days.
