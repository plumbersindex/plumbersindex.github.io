Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous designated usages around your house.</p>
