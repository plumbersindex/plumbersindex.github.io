<p>This device, shortened RPZD, is also extremely reliable in avoiding contamination of water materials. Unlike other gadgets, it is designed for high level dangers. A high level danger is defined as a scenario in which the water backflow could seriously damage individuals. In some cities, these valves must be checked once a year by a certified service technician. The device has a chamber between 2 independent check valves where pressure is kept an eye on.

During the repipe, holes are made in walls to install the new piping. These holes are patched following the installation.</p>
