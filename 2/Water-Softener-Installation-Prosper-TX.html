    <meta name="description" content="Professional Plumbing Contractors Prosper Texas - Limestone dissolved in water is termed "hardness." Ground water dissolves limestone from deposits formed eons ago through the following steps: a) carbon dioxide reacts with water to produce carbonic acid which in the environment exists primarily as the bicarbonate ion (HCO3-1); b) microscopic marine organisms consume this as carbonate and form calcite skeletons which were deposited over millions of years to form limestone deposits which are found extensively in many parts of the world; c) ground water is often slightly to moderately acidic due to anaerobic decomposition and action of bacteria in the soil.">

While there's not an exact timetable as to when you need to repipe your house, you need to certainly look into repiping if they have not been performed in 50 years or more-- especially if you reside in an older home constructed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our a/c unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe just what was incorrect with the unit, how he repaired the problem, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would highly recommend Hunter for any issues you may have.</p>
