<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>

Other great alternatives are overload defense, which switches off the motor if it starts to get too hot; an auto-reverse feature to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty meals get ground up in the disposal. And if your house is on a septic system, you'll need a disposal specifically developed to be utilized with a septic tank. gives an overview 1 of garbage disposals and septic systems.</p>
