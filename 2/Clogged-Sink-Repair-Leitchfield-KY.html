<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

Plumbing- If you are setting up a toilet in a brand-new or remodelled bathroom, installation might need plumbing modifications, which will increase your total cost of installation.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
