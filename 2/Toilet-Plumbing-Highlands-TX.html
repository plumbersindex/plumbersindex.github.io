<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
