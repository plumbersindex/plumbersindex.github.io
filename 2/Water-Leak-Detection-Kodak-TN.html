The solidity minerals, calcium and magnesium are still present and being crystallized. You will no longer have the downside to hard water, i.e., scaling, etching and clogging of aerators while retaining the helpful minerals. Likewise, given that the minerals are not being pulled out of the water, you will not be decreasing the pH, which can trigger water to end up being acidic helping it to stay alkaline which is very advantageous for you and your house.</p>
