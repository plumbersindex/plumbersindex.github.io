<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
