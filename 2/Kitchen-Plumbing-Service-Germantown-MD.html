<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
