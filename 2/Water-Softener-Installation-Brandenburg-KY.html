As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and fractures. If heat is used, the liner is left to solidify in place for several hours or 60 minutes. Once the procedure is total, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be inspected one more time to ensure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
