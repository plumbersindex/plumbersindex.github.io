<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water flow, happens. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to leave. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down lead to a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is just recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
