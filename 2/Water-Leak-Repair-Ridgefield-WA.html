<p>A brand-new water heater will likely last longer, provide you fewer problems, and cost you less to operate gradually. Slow drains: If you discover that your drains are clearing slower, it might be indicative of the early phases of a clog. A trained plumber would not recommend a replacement unless the original toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that is the case they may suggest moving toilets to different bathrooms to lessen any future interruptions. Water heater should be offered by High 5 Plumbing.</p>
