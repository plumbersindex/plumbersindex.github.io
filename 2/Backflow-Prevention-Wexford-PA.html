<p>Just like hiring a plumber for basic repairs, you or your contractor should request evidence of a license and license number. Also verify that employees' compensation and liability insurance policies are active. We're really proud of all the work we do to keep your house comfortable but we have a special affinity for hot water heater installation and replacement. Our advanced knowledge and experience permit us to install new units more efficiently and affordably than anyone you'll discover in the area.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Examine the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
<p>Gas lines undoubtedly need repairs-- age and use will ultimately use them down. Though regular, it's still stressful to a property owner, who might fear the inconvenience of working with a service professional to handle their (potentially) expensive repairs rapidly and efficiently. That's what Mr. Rooter Plumbing is here for. Our inspections ensure you know every potential gas line problem, and our repairs ensure your system is working completely again.</p>

Finally, cold water should be running when the garbage disposal is on and need to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to guarantee that all food particles have been rinsed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're only sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
