<p>You can find great deals of repair directions on the web, so the first thing you need to understand is that for anything beyond a bothersome drip-drip-drip you need to close the shutoff valves below to save water and protect versus the leak unexpectedly becoming worse while you're asleep or away.

<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine travels through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about fully regrowed.</p>
