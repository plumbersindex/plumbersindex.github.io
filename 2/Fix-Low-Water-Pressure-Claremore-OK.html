<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well preserved to help prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to crack and solidify or merely be so squished that it does not fill the area in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
