The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be tested annually. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked each year to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
