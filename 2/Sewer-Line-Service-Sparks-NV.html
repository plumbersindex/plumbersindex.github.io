<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Sparks NV</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system needs to be constantly monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
