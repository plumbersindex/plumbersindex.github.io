<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Wiggins MS</h3>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair costs may remain in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater. To ensure that we are offering top quality work and customer assurance, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to safely perform water heater replacements. In addition to standard hot water heater, we also install tankless hot water heater, and heat pump water heaters.</p>

Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would give a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the situation prior to devoting to a rate, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
