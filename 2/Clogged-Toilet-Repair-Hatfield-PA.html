<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
