<p>When the information collected from the field test shows the assembly has actually broken down in its performance below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers need to only be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if needed, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
