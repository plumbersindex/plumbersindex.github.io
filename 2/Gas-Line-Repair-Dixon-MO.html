While there's not a specific timetable regarding when you should repipe your home, you need to absolutely check out repiping if they have not been done in 50 years or more-- specifically if you reside in an older house developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our air conditioner system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather.
