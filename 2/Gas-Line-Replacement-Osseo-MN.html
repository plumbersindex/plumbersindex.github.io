<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>

Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water actually needs it. Newer systems use digital sensors that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other essential metrics based upon your water use and therefore just regrow when required. These newer systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal since they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
