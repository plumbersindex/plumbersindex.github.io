<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may need to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To prevent this, make sure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation kit includes a tube, or buy one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
