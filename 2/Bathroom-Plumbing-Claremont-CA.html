<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent to drain. This procedure continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
