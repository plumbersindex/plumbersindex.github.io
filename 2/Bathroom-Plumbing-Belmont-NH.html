This department is also accountable for releasing plumbing permits, and signing up licenses for plumbing contractors and water treatment operators.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high danger" establishments.</p>
