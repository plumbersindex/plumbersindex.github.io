<p>The Plumbing Division of the Buildings, Security Engineering and Environmental Department is responsible for ensuring that plumbing systems and experienced trade persons remain in compliance with code and regulation requirements.

This department is also accountable for releasing plumbing permits, and signing up licenses for plumbing contractors and water treatment operators.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high danger" establishments.</p>
