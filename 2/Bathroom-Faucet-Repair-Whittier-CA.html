<p>On average nationwide, it costs in between $120 and $150 to install a waste disposal unit.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools provide contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Extra requirements for potential plumbing business owners may consist of evidence of monetary trustworthiness, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>
