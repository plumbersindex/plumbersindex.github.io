Blocked cleaner can create a toxic swimming pool in your sink, making any new attempt to clear it more dangerous. You'll need to install that first if your disposal's installation will require a new installing flange in the sink. Eliminate it as talked about above if you're changing an old disposer.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
