<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Wauseon OH?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system must be constantly kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
