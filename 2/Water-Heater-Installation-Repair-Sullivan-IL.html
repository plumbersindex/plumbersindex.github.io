<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
