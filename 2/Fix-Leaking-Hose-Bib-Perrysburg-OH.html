<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut down remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
<p>Where the company lies: Beware of contractors who give you a post office box without any street address or usage only an answering service. Never employ somebody who comes unsolicited to your door and can't provide you evidence of credentials-- especially if she or he pressures you to employ fast and pay money up front. Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Check prevents backflow triggered by pressure boosts in the down stream plumbing.</p>
