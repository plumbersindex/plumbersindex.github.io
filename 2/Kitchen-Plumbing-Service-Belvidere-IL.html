<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Belvidere IL</h3>

<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
