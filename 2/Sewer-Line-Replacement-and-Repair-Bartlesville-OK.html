<p>Commercial kitchen waste disposal unit come in various styles and horse power designs to deal with a wide variety of volumes. Light responsibility waste disposal unit are typically required in fast food dining establishments, convenience stores, delicatessens and workplace cooking areas.

A clogged drain can even lead to slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and costly repairs.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
