<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>

The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
