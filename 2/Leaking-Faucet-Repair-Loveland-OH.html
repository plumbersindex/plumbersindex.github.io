It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.
