<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily kept for later use when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
