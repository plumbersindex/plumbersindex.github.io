<h3>How to Get the Best and Fastest Sewer Cleaning Service at Bethel CT</h3>

I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
