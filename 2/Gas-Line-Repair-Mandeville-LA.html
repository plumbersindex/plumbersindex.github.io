<p>Sodium consumption from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or ecological reasons demand limiting sodium, replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be suitable. In time, the beads end up being coated with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning procedure, called regrowth, has 3 cycles: backwash, rinse and recharge. The regeneration procedure can be arranged automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
