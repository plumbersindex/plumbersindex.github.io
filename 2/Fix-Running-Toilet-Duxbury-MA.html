The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
