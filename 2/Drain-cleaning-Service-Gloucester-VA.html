<p>Gas water heaters are easier to repair than electrical ones. A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP waste disposal unit unit can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is extremely little insulation in the weaker models. Plan to replace the water heater right away if you identify a drip. Do not wait till the leak gets bad. The cost to install a waste disposal unit in Florida varies anywhere from $325 to $1,000. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they should be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a huge warning that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
<p>The term difficult water describes water with a high mineral material.

These mineral deposits stay when the water is routed into pipes for residential and commercial use, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>
