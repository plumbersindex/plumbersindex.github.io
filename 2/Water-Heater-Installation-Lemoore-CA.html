<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate gradually, they slowly begin to restrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to occur, so by the time you observe it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
