<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
