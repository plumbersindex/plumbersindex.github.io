<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow protection.

Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>
