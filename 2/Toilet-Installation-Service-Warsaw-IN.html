After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Picture 7) on top of the heater. The smoke must be drawn up the vent pipe. The fumes from the burner aren't venting if the smoke does not draw. Switch off the gas to the hot water heater and call a licensed plumber to remedy the issue.</p>
<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid normally will assist eliminate them if you have rust spots. If you would like to attempt the gentlest technique possibly try using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that doesn't work then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to read the directions and security warnings initially!).
