<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid normally will assist eliminate them if you have rust spots. If you would like to attempt the gentlest technique possibly try using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on.
