While it's not likely that having a disposal launch while your head is pushed versus it will lead to decapitation, it may scare a couple of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience. When to repair: Under no scenarios should your toilet relocation when you sit or press on it.

Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
