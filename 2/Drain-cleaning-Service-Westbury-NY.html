This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is necessary to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its style and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be unwise in many circumstances to install a pipe sector of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
