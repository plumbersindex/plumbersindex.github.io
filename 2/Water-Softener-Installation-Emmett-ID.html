<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>
