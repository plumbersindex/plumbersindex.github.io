<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it tough to get to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big job, replacing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, utility, or basement  room is relatively straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets need to definitely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet ought to be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an every year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked every year to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
