<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable water system and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be installed. An authorized, effectively set up and preserved backflow assembly essentially eliminates the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a much shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability.
