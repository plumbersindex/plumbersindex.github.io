<p>Inspect the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and easy. However finding the right washer might not be. The most common washers are typically offered in your home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to discover. If you decide to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
