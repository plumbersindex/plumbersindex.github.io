About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is utilized throughout the backflush operation. What we indicate is that your toilet is old. Older toilets might work just great, but if your toilet is truly old (and dated in style), you may want to think about a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.
