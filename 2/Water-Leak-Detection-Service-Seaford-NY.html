<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
<p>3. Banging or snapping noises - Over enough time, there might be significant sediment built-up in your hot water heater that can produce this snapping or popping noise that can be quite loud.
