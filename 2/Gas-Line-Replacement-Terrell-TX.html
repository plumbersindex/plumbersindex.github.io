<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Terrell TX</h3>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
