<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Enumclaw WA</h3>
<p>This is an entirely legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, naturally, as essential as your water heater, water line, or drains. Nonetheless, it includes a reasonable amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably little cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid normally will help eliminate them. If you would like to attempt the gentlest technique possibly try utilizing some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not work then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and security cautions first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust discolorations and it's easily offered at many hardware stores.</p>
