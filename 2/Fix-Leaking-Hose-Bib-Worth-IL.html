If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you should require to protect yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.
