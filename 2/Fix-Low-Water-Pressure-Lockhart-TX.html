<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high threat" establishments.</p>
