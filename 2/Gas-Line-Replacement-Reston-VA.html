Bacteria and fungi: If your water supply is not disinfected prior to softening, germs and fungis can possibly grow on the surface area. This can lower the effectiveness of your softener.</p>
<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
