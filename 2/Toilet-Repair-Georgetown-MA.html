<p>Does it look like your drains are always sluggish or clogged? Often, this is triggered by built-up sediment and other products that are causing a clog in your sewer drain.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
