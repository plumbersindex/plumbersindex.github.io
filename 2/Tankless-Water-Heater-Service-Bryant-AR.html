<p>Hot water heater repair can often be cost-prohibitive. You'll spend for the required repairs just to deal with another problem quickly thereafter. Constantly continue to run water throughout and after using your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has actually vanished down the drain.

Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
