<p>While city water does get treated, it is done for purposes of removing bacterial concerns and making the water drinkable. These are definitely priorities for a town and its homeowners but tough water can adversely affect faucets and devices in a house. With the high calcium material of local water, it can trigger a dishwasher or water heater to malfunction. You may be better off repiping if the problem is repeating or the damage is substantial. For small leakages and one-off problems, repairing the pipe is usually enough.</p>
<p>Badly installed gas lines lead to gas leakages. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself job.

I will suggest SW plumbing for any significant repair.</p>

Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the dingy gray brought on by tough water. Please send our thanks to all included with testing, fixing, changing and servicing our softener.
