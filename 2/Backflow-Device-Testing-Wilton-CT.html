<p>Natural Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is completely odor-free. The egg odor related to gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you must require to safeguard yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
