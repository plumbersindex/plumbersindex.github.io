<p>City water mains provide water for a lot of homes and buildings, including the water used in fire defense systems.

Waste disposal unit are an important part of a smoothly operating kitchen. If you do not currently have one, you must be persistent about not letting food go down the drain.

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two indicators of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect gradually, they gradually start to constrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you discover it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, affecting your water quality.</p>
