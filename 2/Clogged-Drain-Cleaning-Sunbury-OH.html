<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be checked yearly. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested every year to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
