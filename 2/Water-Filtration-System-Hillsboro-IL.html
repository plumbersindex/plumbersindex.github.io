The majority of toilet repairs in the Sugar Land, TX area involve clogged drains, which occur when products get stuck in the pipes. In many cases, this involves physical waste and can be cleared up with cautious usage of a plunger. When it doesn't, however, you need a qualified plumber to make it right.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close.
