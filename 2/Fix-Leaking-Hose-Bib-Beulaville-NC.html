<p>Preparation to build a service that is profitable enough to keep your life comfortable? The pipe that connects your sink to the main supply, contains water at high pressures. A leak in this unit will be right away visible. The defected part will either spray or drip a lot, depending on the damage. Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both indoors and underground, DCVs are a little more costly but are also extremely convenient, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically.

If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past.
