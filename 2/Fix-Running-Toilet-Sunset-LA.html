Salt is typically used in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>

This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully regenerated.</p>
