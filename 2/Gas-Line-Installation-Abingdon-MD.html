<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked every year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be evaluated each year to insure the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
