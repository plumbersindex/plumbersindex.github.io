<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
