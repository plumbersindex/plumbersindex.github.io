<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
<p>As tough water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, complimentary" salt ions are released into the water. Softer clothes without difficult minerals trapped in the material. Fabrics last longer and whites remain whiter without the drab gray triggered by tough water. Please send our thanks to all included with testing, fixing, replacing and servicing our softener. Value the time and service you send our method. The replacement tank has actually repaired the issue we were having.</p>
