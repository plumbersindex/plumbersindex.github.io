If you see low water pressure or blemished water, it typically represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop with time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you might discover lower water pressure.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
