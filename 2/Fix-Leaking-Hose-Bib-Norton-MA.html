Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt.

This process continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about fully regrowed.</p>
