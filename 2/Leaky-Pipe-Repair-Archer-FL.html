<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to get away. Sometimes no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a significant pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
