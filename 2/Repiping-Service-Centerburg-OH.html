The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to escape.
