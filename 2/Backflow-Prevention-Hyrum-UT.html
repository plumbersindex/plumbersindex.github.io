That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>

Although colorless, reduced iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Once again, it is suggested to examine the manufacturer's directions for special precautions.</p>
