<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or environmental factors demand limiting sodium, replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be appropriate. In time, the beads end up being coated with minerals and need to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has three cycles: rinse, backwash and recharge. The regeneration process can be set up immediately with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
