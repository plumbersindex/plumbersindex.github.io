In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.
