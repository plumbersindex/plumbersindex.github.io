<p>Salt intake from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be proper if health or environmental factors demand restricting sodium. Gradually, the beads end up being covered with minerals and have to be cleaned up. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: rinse, backwash and recharge. The regrowth procedure can be set up instantly with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>

<p>A reduction in supply side pressure triggered by an occurrence such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire battling, triggers the supply pressure to drop listed below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve allows the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release until the supply side pressure again surpasses the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
