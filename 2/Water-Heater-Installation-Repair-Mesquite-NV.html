<p>Search for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.)

For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these events.</p>
