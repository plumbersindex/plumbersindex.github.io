<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to gain access to in-wall pipes, think about at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, replacing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, basement, or utility  room is fairly straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
