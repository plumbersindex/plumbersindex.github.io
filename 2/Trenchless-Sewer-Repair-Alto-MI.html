<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 indicators of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up gradually, they gradually start to constrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to happen, so by the time you see it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
