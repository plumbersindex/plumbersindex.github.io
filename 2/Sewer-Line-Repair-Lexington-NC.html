<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
