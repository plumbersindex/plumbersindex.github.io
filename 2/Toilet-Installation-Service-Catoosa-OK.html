The riser must be securely connected to sturdy rebar or wood stake to add structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is significantly complete is prohibited unless a check backflow assembly is set up and instantly checked to assure it is working.</p>
