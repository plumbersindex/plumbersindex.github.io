<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the safe and clean supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An authorized, correctly installed and preserved backflow assembly essentially eliminates the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a much shorter life-span than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity.

The drains are connected to vertical pipes that are typically linked to underground horizontal pipes linked to municipal storm sewers.
