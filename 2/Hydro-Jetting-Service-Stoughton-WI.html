<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
