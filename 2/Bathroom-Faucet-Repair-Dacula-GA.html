The consumer has 30 days to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (inspect the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be required to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both places. After an initial inspection and testing of a freshly set up backflow preventer, the water client is needed to have the backflow preventer tested on an annual basis.</p>
<p>A basic repair or replacing individual parts may be all that's required to get your water heater working once again if you have a newer system. You might be tempted to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to conserve cash. While this may work in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the very same product as other pipes in your home, meaning that problem could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you comfort and prevent bigger leakages down the roadway.</p>
