Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. If it doesn't work the first time, you can duplicate this process. We do warm water heaters setups and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the ring up a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>

The size of the bowl along with more options regarding the faucet are all aspects of the procedure that we can help you with.</p>
