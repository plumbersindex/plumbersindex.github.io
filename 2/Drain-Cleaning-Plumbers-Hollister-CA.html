Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Traditionally, the cost savings have actually been based mostly on decreasing chemical and detergent costs. While those cost savings are still substantial, brand-new commercial softening technology using multi-tank systems (MTS) also uses substantial water and salt cost savings.</p>
<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water in fact requires it. When needed, newer systems utilize digital sensors that keep track of bead depletion and other key metrics based on your water usage and therefore only regenerate. These more recent systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
