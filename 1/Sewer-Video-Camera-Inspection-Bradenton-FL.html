<p>Decreasing or getting rid of water solidity is done with a tool called a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process occurs. A softener is comprised of various elements, each having their own distinct purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel usually constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is commonly referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electric timer that charges the system and flushes on a regular schedule.</p>
