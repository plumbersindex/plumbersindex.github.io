A garbage disposal solves all of those problems, adding benefit. Simply turn on water at the sink and the garbage disposal does the rest - and much more quietly than you think.

A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely split and merely needs to be replaced.</p>

When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
