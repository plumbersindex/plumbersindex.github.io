<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. A waste disposal unit solves all of those problems, including convenience. Just switch on water at the sink and the garbage disposal does the rest - and much more quietly than you believe.
