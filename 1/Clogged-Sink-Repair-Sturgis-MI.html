Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
