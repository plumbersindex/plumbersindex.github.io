Similarly, toilets use up such a large part of your bathroom that many people are starting to take them into account when upgrading their bathroom style choices. However that does not imply toilets are ideal-- over time they will need to be repaired when something goes wrong, and they might even eventually need to be changed.

Employing simply anyone to replace your toilet implies you could be entrusted a wobbling seat, concealed leaks that might damage your floors or inappropriate installment that doesn't support effective usage.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
