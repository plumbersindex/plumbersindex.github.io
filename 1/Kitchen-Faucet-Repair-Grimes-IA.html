Scalding water is typically the outcome of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat.

<p>Having gas lines in your property is an incredible luxury. It makes all your cooking jobs simpler and all your convenience requires quicker attainable.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
