<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to escape. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to offer decades of defense. There are lots of regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, temperature or turbidity can all cause the assembly to weaken in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may rarely need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test data from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
