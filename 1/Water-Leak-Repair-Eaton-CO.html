At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener.

PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and remained in broad use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.
