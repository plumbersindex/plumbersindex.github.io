<p>6 - The eluate, which is the wastewater from the regrowth process, streams from the regrowed filter via the eluate degasifier (5) to a tank (6 ). Approx. 40% of the eluate is re-used for the next regrowth cycle.

We service pipelines throughout the state of Georgia, from Atlanta to Athens, Savannah to Augusta, Macon to Marietta, GA, and beyond. The images provide a sample of a backflow device located behind the water meter.</p>
<p>When the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut down stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>

It also saves you cash and time due to the fact that a 2nd inspection isn't essential.</p>
