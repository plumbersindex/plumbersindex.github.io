<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about totally regenerated.</p>
