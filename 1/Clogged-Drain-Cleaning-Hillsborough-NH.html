<p>Search for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Since pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will stream backwards into the city water lines.</p>

<p>A reduction in supply side pressure caused by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire combating, causes the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve permits the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure once again exceeds the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
