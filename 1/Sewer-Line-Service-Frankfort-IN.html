<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Frankfort IN?</h3>
<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow. By installing a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by saving the quantity of trash that gets sent out to landfills and other dumping areas. With a garbage disposal the garbage is managed through already existing water facilities.</p>
