<p>An rdc is similar to a DC because it is a mechanical backflow preventer including 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves. However, it usually does not consist of shutoff valves, might or might not be equipped with test dicks or ports, and is typically less reliable than a DC. An rdc works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but need to be utilized to isolate just nonhealth risks and is planned for usage only in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Potable and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not correctly secured. Backflow Preventer definition: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions.</p>
