<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Fraser MI</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines since pressure is lost during these occasions.</p>
