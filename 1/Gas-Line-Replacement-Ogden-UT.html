There are 2 standard types of toilet flushing systems; both types conserve water by using 1.6 gallons of water per flush.

Look for gravity-fed toilets using high performance to effectively and quietly get rid of waste.</p>
<p>The double check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire security industry, developing a redundancy created to ensure that one check valve will continue to secure the city water supply even if the other fails. This assembly likewise makes it possible for the closure of one valve to minimize the pressure differential throughout the other, developing a more reliable seal and preventing even minor backflow leak.

We highly advise likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
