<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to eliminate wastewater from websites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk includes the oldest known examples of brick constructed Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had replaceable and easily removable sections, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>Trees and shrubs are a common cause of sewer blockages to the house. Roots can turn into the smallest fracture or space in your house's drain pipe, where they prosper in the nutrient abundant environment provided by the sewer. Flat roofings generally have drains spaced out around their border. The drains are connected to vertical pipes that are usually linked to underground horizontal pipes connected to community storm sewage systems. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to bring back circulation and prevent water collection on top of the building's roofing.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is totally stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being destructive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, specifically in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main cause of the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas water heaters with unique venting systems likewise are readily available. But they're harder to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
