Age-- As we mentioned, a 10+ year old hot water heater is probably on its last legs. If you are uncertain how old your unit is, you ought to have the ability to get that info from the serial number on the manufacturer's sticker label (usually near the top of the system). Generally, the very first two numbers suggest the year of your water heater.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
