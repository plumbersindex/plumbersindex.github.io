<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common.

Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
