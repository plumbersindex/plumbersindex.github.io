<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
