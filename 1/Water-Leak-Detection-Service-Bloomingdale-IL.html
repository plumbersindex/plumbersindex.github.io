<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
