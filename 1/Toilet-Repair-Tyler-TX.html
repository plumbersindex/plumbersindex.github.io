Water softeners usually have a life expectancy of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last much longer if they are appropriately kept. Ensuring the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners boost the regeneration cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>

The beads become full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when freshly regrowed. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated, hard water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>
