<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
