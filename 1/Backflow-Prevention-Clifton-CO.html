<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called several of his member contractors to discover what a reasonable and sensible  cost would be for a garbage disposal install. Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally salt. The result is water that's been efficiently softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>

<p>For commercial centers consisting of hotels, universities, and restaurant chains, problems with a hot water heater can have a substantial influence on everyday operations and should be prevented whenever possible.
