A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>If you are in a position that you see the indications of a gas line leak, the most essential thing to do is to get out of your home as quickly as possible.

Next, call your local plumbing professional so they can come, inspect the line, and see if repair or replacement is needed. A trustworthy company like Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating can provide gas line installation to replace the broken pipe.</p>
