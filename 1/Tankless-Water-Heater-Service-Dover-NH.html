<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Dover NH?</h3>
<p>If you are updating your gas devices, you need to upgrade the piping too. Gas leaks can be scary and unsafe. We're here for you every action of the way. Call (866) 701-5306 to arrange a consultation. An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically specified by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect versus back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
