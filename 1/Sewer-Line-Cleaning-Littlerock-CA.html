The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
