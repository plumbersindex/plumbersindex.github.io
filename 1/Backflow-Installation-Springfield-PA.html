<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly kept for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
