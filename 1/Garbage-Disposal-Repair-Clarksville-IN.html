<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
