Fees can rise for more involved or difficult installations, such as if access is minimal or pipes need changing. Picking a greater priced plumber typically pays off in the long run, however.

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
