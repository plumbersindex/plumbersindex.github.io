<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is particularly susceptible to repeating pinhole leakages (corrosion that breaks through the surface of piping), so keep an eye out for bluish-greenish rust on copper piping. Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals include this setting, which reverses the instructions the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they don't wear as fast. All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
