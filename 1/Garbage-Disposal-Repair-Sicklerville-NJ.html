During sewer camera inspection, our technician will locate a gain access to indicate your sewer line and then insert a high-definition camera that provides a feedback to the service technician as it travels through the pipeline. Old age: If your water heater isn't working like it used to and it is at or above 10-15 years of age, it might be time to replace your unit. Hot water heater just have a life span of 10-15 years.

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
