<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned).
