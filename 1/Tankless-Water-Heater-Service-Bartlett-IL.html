<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is required to get rid of the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simplicity of its style and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be unwise in many situations to install a pipe sector of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
