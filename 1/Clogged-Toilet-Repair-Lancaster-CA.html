<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
