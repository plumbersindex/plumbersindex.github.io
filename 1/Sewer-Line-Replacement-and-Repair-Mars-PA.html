Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
