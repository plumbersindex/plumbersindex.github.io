<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might have to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
