<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to access to in-wall pipes, think about at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic functional usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard versus back pressure.
