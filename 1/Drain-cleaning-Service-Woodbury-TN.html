<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing interruption service might seem like a waste of money. Why purchase professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice? While chemical drain cleaners may be a low-cost solution, the severe ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, with time, developing vulnerable points in the pipe that are most likely to rupture. Handling repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has already been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Again, it is advisable to examine the maker's directions for special preventative measures.</p>
