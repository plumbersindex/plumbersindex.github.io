Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A garbage disposal is an essential kitchen home appliance in a lot of houses today. While a lot of kitchen sink disposers can manage almost any type of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other item jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Used impellers on older disposals can become ineffective, increasing the risk of drain clogs.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of disposals: batch feed and continuous feed. Many homes utilize continuous feed disposals, which means the disposal will work as long as it is switched on. This is handy when a lot of work is to be carried out in the kitchen. When the lid is closed, batch disposals have a holding tank that builds up waste up until it is complete and is then triggered. Our plumbers can help you choose which type of disposal will work best for your sink.</p>

Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink.
