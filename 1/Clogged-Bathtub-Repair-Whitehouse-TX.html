Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things differently could have saved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>

Mechanical determines utilized to measure test pressures will have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not higher than five times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will require an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be carried out using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not show the minimum pressure required for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as suggested by pressure determines during inspection will be considered to suggest the existence of a leak.</p>
