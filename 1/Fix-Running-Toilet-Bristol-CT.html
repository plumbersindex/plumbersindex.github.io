<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Bristol CT</h3>

I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
