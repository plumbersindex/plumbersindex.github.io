<p>We focus on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Softened water is not recommended for watering house lawns, gardens and plants due to its salt content. Water used in recharging a water softener may overload or minimize the effectiveness of small septic or sewer systems. Salt consumption might pose health threats. Softened water is not advised for steam irons or evaporative coolers. The very best option for such appliances is distilled water or water from a reverse osmosis unit.

Many clogs are brought on by putting too much toilet tissue into the bowl. Be aware of just how much bathroom tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush.

<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often becomes corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in locations where water sits for extended periods of time.

Many residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas water heaters with special venting systems likewise are available. But they're harder to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
