<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
