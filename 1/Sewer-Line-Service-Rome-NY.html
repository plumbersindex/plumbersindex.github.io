<p>Our recommendation: Normally you'll want to opt for PEX pipes not only because they are economical, however due to the fact that they're reliable and easy to install. If you have questions about what type is pipe is right  for your home, seek advice from a plumber for more information. Attach the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the mounting ring to the flange from underneath the sink. Make sure you snap the backup ring in place.

More costly gas hot water heater with special venting systems likewise are readily available. However they're more difficult to install, and we will not deal with them here.</p>
