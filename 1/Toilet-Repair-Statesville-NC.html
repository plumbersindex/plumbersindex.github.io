Eventually, you'll need to count on a trusted plumber to encourage you whether it's time for a pipe replacement. And it's constantly good to get an even third and second opinion before you embark on a replacement job. But there are a couple of methods you can reduce the cost and trouble of the task.</p>
<p>Any sewer-related checks will require a camera inspection. For a sewer camera inspection, a camera can be put down the drain in a sink to inspect the pipes in the house, or an outdoor pipe to examine the sewer main in the lawn. Sewer video cameras can go hundreds of feet into the pipe, so they can be used to scope the main line.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
