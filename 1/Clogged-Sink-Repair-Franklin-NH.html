<h3>Blocked Drain Cleaning: Why Hire A Professional in Franklin NH?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system needs to be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
