<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
