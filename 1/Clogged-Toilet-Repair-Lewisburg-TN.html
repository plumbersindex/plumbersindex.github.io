<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
