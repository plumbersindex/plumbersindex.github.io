<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in provided pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to leave. In some cases no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of the inherent design of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an extremely low flow or fixed flow condition might cause nuisance leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.
