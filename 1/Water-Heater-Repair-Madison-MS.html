<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey.

While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many desired usages around your house.</p>
