<p>Finally, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure triggered by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop listed below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve enables the excess customer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release until the supply side pressure again surpasses the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
