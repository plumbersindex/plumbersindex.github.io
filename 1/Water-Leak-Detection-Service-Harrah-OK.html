<p>As tough water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, complimentary" sodium ions are released into the water. Softer clothes without tough minerals caught in the material. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the run down gray caused by tough water. Please send our thanks to all involved with testing, fixing, changing and servicing our softener. Value the time and service you send our method. The replacement tank has fixed the problem we were having.</p>
