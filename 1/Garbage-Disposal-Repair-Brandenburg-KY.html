<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regrowed, the beads become filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, tough water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these signs.</p>
<p>Restore your softener with potassium chloride instead of salt chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is readily available at many stores that sell softener salt. A single tank or cabinet-style system requires less area due to the fact that the softener's salt water tank nests within the salt tank.
