<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet in Paola KS</h3>
<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
