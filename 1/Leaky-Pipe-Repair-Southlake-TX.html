<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes.

That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
