This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is needed to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its style and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be not practical in many circumstances to install a pipe segment of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Given that I like to cook, I create a whole lot of dishes. We set up a temporary workaround at our guest bathroom sink, however after a day of this we recognized that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the home within 30 minutes and he ensures that the sink will remain clog-free for thirty days. If it obstructs again within that time, he will come out and fix it free of charge - that is what I call service!  We are extremely pleased that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company again and again in the future.</p>
