<p>Unless your bathroom renovation is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might effectively become part of your project requirements. Water gets in the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which draws in the favorably charged minerals in the water (a process known as, ion exchange).

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.
