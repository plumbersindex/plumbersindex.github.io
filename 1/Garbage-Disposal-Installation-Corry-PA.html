<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it difficult to access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, replacing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, basement, or utility  room is fairly straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
