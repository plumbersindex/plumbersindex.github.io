Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things differently might have conserved her a great deal of money. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
