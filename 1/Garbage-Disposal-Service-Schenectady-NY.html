Nevertheless, it generally does not consist of shutoff valves, may or may not be geared up with test cocks or ports, and is normally less reliable than a DC. An rdc works versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but ought to be used to isolate only nonhealth threats and is intended for use just in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both places. The backflow preventer you pick should be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted need to have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
