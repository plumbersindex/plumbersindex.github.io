<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one instructions, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. However is a plumbing catastrophe imminent or just a concern for the long run? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floors, so you certainly do not want to do the job prior to it's required.

The more of these fixtures you have, the more pricey the task will be. That's because the plumber has to replace the secondary drain and incoming lines (see image below) for each plumbing component. Replacing the pipes for many plumbing components requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
