While gas leakages are rare, you need to leave the building right away if you notice an odor like rotten eggs in your residential or commercial property. A gas leak can have almost instant effects on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. Get out of the home and call us right away if you have actually got a gas pipe leaking.</p>
