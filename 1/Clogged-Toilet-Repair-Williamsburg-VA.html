The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to escape. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
