<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regrow after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
