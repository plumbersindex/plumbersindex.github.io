<h3>When To Call A Plumber Brockport NY</h3>
<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its normal flow. IRWD's safe and clean water supply is designed to keep the water flowing to you.

This produces a backflow condition and the potential for polluted water getting in the potable water distribution system. Copper is a biostatic material, which implies bacteria will not grow on it. Copper has actually been utilized (along with PVC pipes) since the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old structures.

Consequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system.

Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked yearly to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
