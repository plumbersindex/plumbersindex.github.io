<h3>When To Call A Plumber Brockport NY</h3>
<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its normal flow. IRWD's safe and clean water supply is designed to keep the water flowing to you.

Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked yearly to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
