<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then return to service. Because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles however will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are hassle-free if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly restored. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions.
