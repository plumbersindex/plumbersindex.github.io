<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Mitchell IN?</h3>
<p>Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is entirely odorless. The egg smell associated with natural gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are security preventative measures you must take to protect yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
