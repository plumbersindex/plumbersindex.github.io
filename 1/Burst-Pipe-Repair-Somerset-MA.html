Backflow is a problem because it can trigger wastewater to recede into a home, contaminating the drinking water. Cover the flapper valve with your hand.

This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water supplier.</p>
