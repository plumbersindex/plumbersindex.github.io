<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Artesia NM</h3>
<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale buildup and provide brighter clothing and softer skin using a healthier method. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without needing to include sodium to the water. This is a more heart healthy and environmentally friendly system. Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative effect on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no drainage, no salt and no electricity or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last approximately 5 years without replacing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a monthly basis.</p>
