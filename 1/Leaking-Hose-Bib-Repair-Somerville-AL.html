Due to the fact that the baffle successfully halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly true. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
