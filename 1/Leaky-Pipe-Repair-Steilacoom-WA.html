<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5). Examine the directions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
