<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the beginning of our home improvements. George and Anthony did a remarkable task for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular requirements for our house. I will constantly use them and request George specifically for all future problems or repairs. They were timely and offered excellent pricing for what we required done. I highly advise this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to push the ring up a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
