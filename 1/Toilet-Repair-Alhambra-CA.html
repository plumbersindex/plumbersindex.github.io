The water suppliers typically do not have the capability to consistently inspect every consumer's facilities for cross-connections and backflow protection. Usually, this would include the water service connection to each dedicated fire security system or irrigation piping system and the water service connection to each of the list below types of premises: (1) facilities with an auxiliary or recovered water system; (2) industrial, medical, laboratory, other or marine facilities where objectionable compounds are managed in a way that could cause contamination or contamination of the public water supply; (3) properties exempt from the State Plumbing Code inspection and properties where an internal backflow prevention assembly required under the State Plumbing Code is not effectively installed or preserved; (4) categorized or restricted centers; and (5) tall buildings.</p>
