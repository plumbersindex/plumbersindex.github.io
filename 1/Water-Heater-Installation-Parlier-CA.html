<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply motion. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to escape. Sometimes no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>

The resulting soft water is more suitable with soap and extends the life time of some appliances. Water softening is generally achieved using ion-exchange resins.
