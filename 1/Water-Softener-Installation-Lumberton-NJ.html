<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this large amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hindering water flow. By setting up a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the amount of garbage that gets sent to garbage dumps and other discarding areas. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
