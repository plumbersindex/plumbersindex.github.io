<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Kennesaw GA</h3>
<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be performed through the taps. This will cause your water to look rusty or brown, and the water might have a bad or nasty odor to it. When the piping in your home begins to reveal any of these indications of rust, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the entire plumbing system. The factor a toilet will not flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain underneath the toilet can also be the cause. Working with a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your first step; a plumber can identify the problem and repair it.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
