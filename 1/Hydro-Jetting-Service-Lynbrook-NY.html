Cracks in the Porcelain: Cracks in the toilet bowl can result in bathroom flooding if not attended to rapidly. Indications of distress in the porcelain include spider veins spreading across the bowl or base. It's an excellent concept to replace the unit prior to it stops working.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regenerated, the beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to lower these signs.</p>
