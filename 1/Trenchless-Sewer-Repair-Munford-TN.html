<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Undetected water leakages might lead to mold development. Plumbers frequently replace outdoor gas piping with continuous, water resistant, flexible polyethylene gas piping with risers at the pipe entry and exit points to keep water out of the system.
