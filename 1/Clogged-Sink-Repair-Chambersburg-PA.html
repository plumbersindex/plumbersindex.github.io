<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I enjoy to cook, I generate a lot of meals. We set up a short-lived workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we realized that we required the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the home within 30 minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for 30 days. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely pleased that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company once again and again in the future.</p>
