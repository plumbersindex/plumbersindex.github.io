Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A garbage disposal is an important kitchen device in most homes today. While most kitchen sink disposers can handle practically any sort of food waste, they are not unbreakable. When a fork, bone or other object jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running.

<p>Align the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange beneath the sink. Press it into location, and loosely protect it by rotating the lower installing ring onto the ramp tabs of the upper mounting ring. Rotate disposer unit as needed to align drain assembly. There's a nasty odor originating from your drains - You may not notice this right now, however nasty odors suggest whatever is stuck in your drains-- most likely food waste-- is decomposing in there.
