Here are some things to search for when thinking about the well being of your San Antonio water heater. The biggest drain on your home is your sewer line. All your drains empty into the main sewer lines and when it is running properly, it will flow to the city's sewer line. Still, as in numerous things in life, problems take place and need attention.</p>

Sluggish drains: If you see that your drains are clearing slower, it could be a sign of the early stages of a clog. A trained plumber would not recommend a replacement unless the initial toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that is the case they might suggest moving toilets to different bathrooms to lessen any future stoppages. Water heater must be provided by High 5 Plumbing.</p>
