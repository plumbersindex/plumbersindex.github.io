Guarantee you don't have a plumbing disaster and ensure your pipes are clean. Check water or air test on system. Air Test: 5 psi or Water Test: 10 foot head of pressure. The test shall hold for a minimum of 15 minutes without leaks. 2. DO toss a few lemon or orange peels into your disposal from time to time to help it operate properly - and to make your kitchen odor fresh and clean.</p>
<p>The cost depends on the size of the home and the variety of restrooms and plumbing fixtures-- utility room, wet bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to access to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your final costs. While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth process. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close.
