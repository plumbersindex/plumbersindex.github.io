Well, very first let's ask you a different question: How old is your home? If it was built prior to 1970, it may have pipes made from an out-of-date material that will start to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't currently). And if your house was constructed prior to World War II, then it probably requires replacements for its old pipes, most likely whole-house repiping.</p>

Higher horse power: Horse power (HP) determines how powerful a garbage disposal is. Garbage disposal HP ranges from 1/3 to 1, however for most single-family houses a 1/2 or 3/4 HP unit will work just fine. If you have a big family or do a lot of cooking, you might think about a 1 HP garbage disposal.</p>
