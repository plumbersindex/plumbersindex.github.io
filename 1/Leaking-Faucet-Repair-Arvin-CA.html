Clogged drains can rapidly become significant problems if not handled correctly. Call us today at (303) 758-6237 for quick, accurate service in Denver and the surrounding locations. We've currently seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the difference in between them? When it comes to the problem of difficult water, a traditional water softener really gets rid of magnesium, silica and calcium ions, leaving it with small amounts of what is referred to as temporary solidity". The softener changes these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
