The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to make sure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and spying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
