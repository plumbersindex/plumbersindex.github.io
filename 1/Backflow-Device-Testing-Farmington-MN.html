<p>A few local authorities need that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high end of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any area where it may ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not enable the use of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some do not enable the use of a PVB at all, so check with your water company. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow happens, so it must be installed in a place where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
