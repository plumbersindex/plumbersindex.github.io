The typical use for lubricant in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently oiled to guarantee they do not roll out of their retainer. Making use of excessive lubricant can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out faster by attracting dirt and debris or limiting the movement of the element.

For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and split or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the space along with it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything remains in good shape.</p>
