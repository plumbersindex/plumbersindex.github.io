Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem.
