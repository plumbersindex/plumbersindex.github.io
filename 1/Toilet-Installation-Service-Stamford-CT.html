<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future.

A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Often a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
