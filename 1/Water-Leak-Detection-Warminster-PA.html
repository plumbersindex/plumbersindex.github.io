<p>Most of the times, the gas leakage is brought on by a change that somehow impacts the gas lines. Something as trivial as moving a gas clothes dryer for any function whatsoever can harm the gas pipe. Gas lines which are flexible are prone to crimping and leaking, others made from unsuitable, low-grade material likewise end up being breakable rapidly and rust away, triggering a serious leak. Many times, an installation by less than professional likewise trigger gas leakages.
