If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security preventative measures you must require to secure yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise allow options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.
