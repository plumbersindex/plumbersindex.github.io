The main advantage with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without having to include sodium to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Conventional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have an unfavorable impact on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are beginning to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and use no waste water, no salt and no electricity or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are incredibly low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last as much as 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>
