<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Toilet performance- The greater the efficiency of the toilet, the more it costs. The efficiency of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an ecological toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based).
