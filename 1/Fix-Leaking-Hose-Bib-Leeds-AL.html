<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which may bring dirty water or other, hazardous substances into the general public water supply and personal plumbing. Backflow can occur in a number of scenarios that may draw water from locations such as garden fountains, pool, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outside water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
