<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the magnificence in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge between male and machine. After all, if the journey lever doesn't lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to jiggle and wiggle and in some cases even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper by hand.

This problem is typically triggered by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a broken flapper valve. A drip pan is low-cost and effective. The drip pan is installed under the water heater in order to gather any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the home or into an appropriate drain. When the water heater is being replaced, a perfect time to install a drip or replace pan is.</p>
