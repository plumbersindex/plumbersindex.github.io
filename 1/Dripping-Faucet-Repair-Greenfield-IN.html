Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
