<p>The check assembly was developed in the 1950s for the fire defense market, developing a redundancy developed to guarantee that one check valve will continue to safeguard the city supply of water even if the other stops working. This assembly also allows the closure of one valve to minimize the pressure differential throughout the other, creating a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor backflow leak.

<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the typical reasons for gas leakages. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning devices take place most frequently in the winter season.

We suggest setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to signal you of any potential gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>
