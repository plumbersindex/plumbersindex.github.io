<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted brine option after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose firmly and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hose pipes must have an air space. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air space may be used to achieve this, and may be needed depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>

A backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from receding to the City system if pressure is lost. Backflow can infect the water supply.

<p>More complicated is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has actually discovered prevalent usage since it avoids both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are set up in line with the pipeline and run individually of each other. A set of 4 test dicks allow the operator to examine the valves and make certain they are not being required open by accumulated debris. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to permit water at anticipated operational pressure to flow through. Should backflow take place, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, avoiding the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
