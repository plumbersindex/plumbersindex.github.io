<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to gain access to in-wall pipes, consider at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, changing exposed pipes in a energy, crawlspace, or basement room is relatively simple, since the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets should absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be replaced. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>

The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
