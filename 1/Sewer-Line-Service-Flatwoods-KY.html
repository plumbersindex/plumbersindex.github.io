<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
