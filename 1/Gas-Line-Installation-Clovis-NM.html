<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that need to also be well maintained to assist prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to break and solidify or merely be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location.

We highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
