<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to business? The timing of regrowth depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water actually needs it. When required, newer units use electronic sensors that monitor bead depletion and other key metrics based on your water usage and therefore just regrow. These more recent systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
