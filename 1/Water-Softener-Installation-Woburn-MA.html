<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
