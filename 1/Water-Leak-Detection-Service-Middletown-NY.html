You could have a problem with high water pressure if your water heater stops working due to sediment develop up in the tank. The water pressure builds and may ultimately cause the tank to blow up. This causes thousands of dollars in water and residential or commercial property damage to your house.</p>
<p>The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; additional, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for homeowners. A PE or RA can help determine if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss. Manufacturers of PVC or polyethylene gas piping and its connecting fittings include Dormont, DriscoPlex, GasTite, Endot, Pro-Flex, Lyall Lyco, Yellowpipe, and others.</p>

For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger deterioration that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line.</p>
