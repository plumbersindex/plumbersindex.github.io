<p>This is a totally legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, of course, as crucial as your water heater, water line, or drains. However, it adds a fair quantity of performance to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a fairly small cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal unit takes down wastewater and any material debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
