<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best first experience with the start of our house improvements. George and Anthony did a fantastic task for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They likewise worked around our specific needs for our home.

<p>You can discover lots of repair directions on the internet, so the very first thing you need to know is that for anything beyond a bothersome drip-drip-drip you ought to close the shutoff valves below to save water and protect against the leak all of a sudden worsening while you're asleep or away. You should also understand that except for cosmetically patching a chip in the porcelain and sealing around the joint, there's very little to repair on the sink itself; a problem will imply a sink replacement.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the problem. You may need to look into using a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
