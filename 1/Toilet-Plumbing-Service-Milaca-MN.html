Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed due to the fact that of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
