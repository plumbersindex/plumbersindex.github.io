<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
