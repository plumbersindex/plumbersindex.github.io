<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
