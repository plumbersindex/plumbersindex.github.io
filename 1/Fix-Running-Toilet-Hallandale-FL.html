<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly restored, the beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is heated, tough water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>

Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water solidity can be eliminated fairly quickly by utilizing an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to positively charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
