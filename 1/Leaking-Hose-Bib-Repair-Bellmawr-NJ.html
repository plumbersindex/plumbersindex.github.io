<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is needed to get rid of the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its design and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be impractical in lots of situations to install a pipe sector of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
