<p>Leakages are sly. While the time needed will vary based on your house size and the number of found malfunctions, it's best to set aside as much as two hours when you schedule an inspection.

If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the job (unless you have a very little plumbing system). When you contact us to arrange your visit, ask how long the inspection usually takes.</p>
