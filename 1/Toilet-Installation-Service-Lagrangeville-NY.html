Making use of these products is called chemigation. There are a number of elements to this valve. The check valve has a spring ran flapper, which permits circulation in only one direction.

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
