<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should also be well kept to assist prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to split and solidify or just be so squished that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
