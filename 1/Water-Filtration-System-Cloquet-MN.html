<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house.

A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). If your valve is a various design from the one we show, examine the directions. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
