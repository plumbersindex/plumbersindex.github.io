<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to business? The timing of regeneration depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water actually requires it. When required, newer units use electronic sensors that keep an eye on bead deficiency and other essential metrics based on your water use and therefore just restore. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal because they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
