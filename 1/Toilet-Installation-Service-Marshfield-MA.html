<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
