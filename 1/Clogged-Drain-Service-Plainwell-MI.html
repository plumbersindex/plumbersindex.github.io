If you do not discover the odor coming from the sewer backup, you might identify this problem since a backup occurs whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for appropriate drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's a separated issue with only that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
