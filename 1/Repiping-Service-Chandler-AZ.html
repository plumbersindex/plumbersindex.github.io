If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>
