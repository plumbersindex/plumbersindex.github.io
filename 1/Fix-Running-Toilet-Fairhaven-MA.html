<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system needs to be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>

Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water hardness can be removed relatively quickly by using an ion exchange procedure. Standard water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations describe positively charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
