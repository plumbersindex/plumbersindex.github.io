<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Martinsville IN</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
