<p>Leakages can occur if the seal between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain stops working. Because the tank or the whole toilet must be raised off the floor for a correct repair, either of these leakages can be tough to fix by yourself. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a a lot more costly repair. Ryan's Plumbing has thoroughly trained personnel who will treat your toilet and home with the utmost care.</p>
<p>A leaking toilet is another common problem homeowners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than most likely means your toilet has a leak. This concern is typically caused by a corroded pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a worn flapper valve. A drip pan is inexpensive and reliable. The drip pan is installed under the hot water heater in order to collect any extraneous dripping water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into a suitable drain. A perfect time to replace or install a drip pan is when the water heater is being changed.</p>
