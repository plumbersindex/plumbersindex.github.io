<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
