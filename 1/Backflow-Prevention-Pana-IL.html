While gas models are less costly to operate, they do require an existing natural gas line. The price tag of an electrical hot water heater is typically lower, however it can be more costly to operate. Electric varieties are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
