While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will develop.
