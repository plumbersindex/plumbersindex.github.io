<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect with time, they gradually start to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much accumulation to occur, so by the time you notice it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, impacting your water quality.</p>
