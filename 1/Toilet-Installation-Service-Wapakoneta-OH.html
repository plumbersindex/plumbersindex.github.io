<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a decline in provided pressure to the water circulation. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to get away.
