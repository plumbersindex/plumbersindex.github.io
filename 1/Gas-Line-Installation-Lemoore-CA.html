<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to service? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water really needs it. More recent systems utilize digital sensing units that keep track of bead exhaustion and other key metrics based upon your water use and therefore just regrow when needed.
