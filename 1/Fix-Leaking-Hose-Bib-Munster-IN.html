<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve allows the excess customer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release until the supply side pressure again surpasses the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
