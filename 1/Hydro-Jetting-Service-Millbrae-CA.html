<p>On top of the cost of the actual disposal, a lot of waste disposal unit installers charge a hourly rate and can set up a garbage disposal in a couple of hours. Getting rid of an old garbage disposal does take additional time, however all the necessary plumbing and electrical wiring will currently be in place for setting up the brand-new one.
