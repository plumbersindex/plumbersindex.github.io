<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.
