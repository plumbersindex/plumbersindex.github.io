<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions.

We recommend installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to signal you of any potential gas leaks if you haven't done so already.</p>
