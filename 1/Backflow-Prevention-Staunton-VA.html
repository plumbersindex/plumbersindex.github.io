We can help if you are presently experiencing clogged drains! When one or more of your drains are clogged, water will frequently start to back up into your sink, which can cause weird smells. A blocked drain can also cause problems when flushing the toilet and result in other drain concerns, like water leakages and bursting pipes.</p>
<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 usually depending on the length from the main gas line.

Many residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas water heaters with unique venting systems also are offered. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
