<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to remove hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process called Design template Assisted Formation (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that will not adhere to any surface in your house, keeping your appliances and warm water heaters free of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also referred to as water conditioners because they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it.
