<p>Unfortunately, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically becomes destructive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in locations where water sits for extended periods of time.

Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas hot water heater with unique venting systems also are available. But they're more difficult to install, and we will not deal with them here.</p>
