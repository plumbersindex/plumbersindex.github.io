<p>Water heater repair can often be cost-prohibitive. You'll pay for the required repairs only to face another issue shortly thereafter. Constantly continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Preferably, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has actually disappeared down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
