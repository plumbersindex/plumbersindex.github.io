Plastic pipes likewise have questionable joining methods. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and lead to water damage.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
