So save yourself some serious problem by being honest with yourself about where your experience level is. Most backflow preventers are designed to enable the parts to be gotten rid of for repair while the main body stays set up in the piping system. Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not necessary most of the times. Some components such as relief valve bodies may need to be eliminated from the main body to facilitate a repair. Understanding the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
