Always continue to run water throughout and after using your disposal. Preferably, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has disappeared down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
