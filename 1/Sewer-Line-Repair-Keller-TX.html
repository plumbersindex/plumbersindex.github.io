The main benefit with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to add salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and environmentally friendly system. Traditional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative effect on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and use no waste water, no electricity and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are extremely low maintenance since the media can last as much as 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a regular monthly basis.</p>
