<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
