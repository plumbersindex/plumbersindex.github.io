<p>We specialize in storm drain inspections and cleaning. Softened water is not recommended for watering home gardens, plants and lawns due to its sodium content. Water used in charging a water softener may overload or lower the efficiency of little septic or sewer systems. Salt consumption might posture health risks.

Mechanical gauges used to determine test pressures will have a variety such that the greatest end of the scale is not higher than 5 times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will require a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test could be performed using a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection.

<p>Installation and replacement costs are often similar, though replacement usually will not require service charges, such as application costs. New meters need to fulfill regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas companies may require a special meter for their services, restricting your choices. Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number listed on the structure permit. Inspections must be made after structure excavation (before putting concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon conclusion. NOTE: If defective work is discovered, the inspector will release an infraction notice, and a specific amount of time is set aside to correct the problem.</p>
