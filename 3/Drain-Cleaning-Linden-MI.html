When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home.

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply.
