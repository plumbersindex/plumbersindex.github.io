<p>A reduction in supply side pressure brought on by an event such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve enables the excess consumer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge till the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about fully restored.</p>
