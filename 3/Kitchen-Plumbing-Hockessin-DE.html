Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be tested regularly to ensure they are operating effectively. A visual check of air spaces suffices, but mechanical backflow preventers have to be evaluated with properly adjusted gauge devices.</p>
