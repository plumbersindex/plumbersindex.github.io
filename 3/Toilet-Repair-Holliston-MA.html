<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
<p>Low Water Pressure - Low water pressure is the leading concern with most homes and organisation' alike. Simply stated it is difficult to get casserole dishes or any large serving piece clean without any pressure in the faucet or sprayer. Mineral deposits are also a major culprit, blockages from food bits, blockages in aerator screens all definitely stop water flow. The most serious could be water leaking, blocked lines to the cut off, and even worse a frozen pipe coming into your home or structure.</p>
