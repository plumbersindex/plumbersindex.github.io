<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the best length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To avoid this, make certain the brand-new waste disposal unit installation set consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
