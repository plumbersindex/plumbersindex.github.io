<p>It's also a great idea to have your toilet checked if it was produced before 1994, as older toilets are typically much less efficient than newer models. You might be squandering hundreds of gallons of water and hundreds of dollars on an ineffective toilet. If you want to put brand-new pipes in your house or you're constructing a house, there are 3 types of brand-new plumbing pipe available that are building-code approved for homes-- copper, PEX, and CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride).
