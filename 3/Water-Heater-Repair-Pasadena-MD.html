<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in different parts of the plumbing system, most commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation concerns or even stop a fixture from flowing entirely. The next typical issue that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the readily available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
