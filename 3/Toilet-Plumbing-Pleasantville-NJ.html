<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the method laid out above. Because the baffle efficiently halves the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is specifically real when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
