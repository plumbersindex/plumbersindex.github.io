<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to business? The timing of regrowth depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water in fact requires it. More recent units use electronic sensors that keep track of bead exhaustion and other key metrics based on your water usage and therefore just restore when needed. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
