Age-- As we discussed, a 10+ years of age hot water heater is most likely on its last legs. If you are not exactly sure how old your unit is, you should be able to get that information from the serial number on the maker's sticker (generally near the top of the system). Generally, the first two numbers indicate the year of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.
