<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
