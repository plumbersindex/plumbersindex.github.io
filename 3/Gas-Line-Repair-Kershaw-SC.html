<p>When the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly.
