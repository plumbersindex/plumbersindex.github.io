<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
