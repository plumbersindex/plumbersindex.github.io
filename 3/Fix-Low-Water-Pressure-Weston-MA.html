<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>

Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
