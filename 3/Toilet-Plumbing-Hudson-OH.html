<p>If you're having a brand-new yard watering system set up, you'll need to have the backflow valve tested every year moving forward.

<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high end of the irrigated area. It might not be set up in any place where it may ever be submerged under water. Some municipalities do not permit the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some do not permit the usage of a PVB at all, so contact your water company. A PVB backflow preventer might spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow occurs, so it should be set up in a location where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are otherwise required in lots of fire security systems, nevertheless. Requireds for installing backflow preventers are set forth by local plumbing codes implemented and established by organizations like municipalities, water purveyors, and plumbing inspectors to protect local drinking products.
