<h3>Clogged Pipes in Whittier California</h2>
<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
