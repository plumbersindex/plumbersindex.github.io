<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
