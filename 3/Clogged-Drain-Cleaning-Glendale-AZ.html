If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6).

Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Inspect the instructions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
