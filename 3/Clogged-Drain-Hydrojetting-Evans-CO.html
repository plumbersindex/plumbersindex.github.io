<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
