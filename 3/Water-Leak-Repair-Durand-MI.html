<h3>Water Softening in Durand Maine</h2>
<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
