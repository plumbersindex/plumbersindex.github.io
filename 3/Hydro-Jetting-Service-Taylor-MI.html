<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company at Taylor MI</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
