Gurgling sounds from a toilet are triggered by air in the drain and ventilation system. A blocked toilet drain or vent line is the root problem.

<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it hard to access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets need to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet ought to be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>
