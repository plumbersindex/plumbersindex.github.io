<p>Slow drains. A sluggish drain can be a typical plumbing concern, and the majority of obstructions can be fixed with an easy fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. The issue can be a deeper obstruction somewhere in the main sewer line if the basic unclogging approaches do not work to solve the slow drain. Unfortunately, mainline blockages are generally much larger blockages than need more than basic unclogging methods, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
<p>More complex is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has found prevalent usage given that it prevents both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are arranged in line with the pipeline and run individually of each other. A set of four test dicks allow the operator to analyze the valves and ensure they are not being forced open by accumulated particles. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to permit water at expected operational pressure to flow through. Should backflow take place, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, preventing the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water circulation, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to leave. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down lead to a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
