While the time required will vary based on your home size and the variety of discovered malfunctions, it's best to set aside approximately 2 hours when you schedule an inspection. There's always the chance that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the task (unless you have a very small plumbing system). When you contact us to arrange your visit, ask for how long the inspection normally takes.</p>
<p>Physical damage: If you notice any physical damage to the unit, it may be time for a professional hot water heater replacement. Leakages, dents, and cracks can add to water damage or electrical failures. Properties with water wells: Characteristic on well water must have an RP backflow preventer on their service line isolating the general public water system from the property. The RP for a home with a water well must be tested upon installation and then each year.</p>
