Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
