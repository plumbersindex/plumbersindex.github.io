Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a couple of things in a different way could have saved her a great deal of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or decreased pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>It's also an excellent idea to have your toilet inspected if it was produced before 1994, as older toilets are typically much less efficient than newer designs. You could be squandering hundreds of gallons of water and hundreds of dollars on an ineffective toilet.

PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are exceptional alternatives to the expensive copper piping.</p>
