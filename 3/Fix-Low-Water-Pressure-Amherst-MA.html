<p>Backflow preventers should only be fixed when the data collected from the field test suggests the assembly has actually broken down in its performance below the developed minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if needed, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow.

<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Amherst MA</h3>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
