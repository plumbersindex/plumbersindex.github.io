Your hot water heater is dead when the tank leaks. The dead giveaway that your hot water heater needs changing is a sluggish drip underneath, typically showing up as a path of rusty water. This suggests that the steel tank has actually rusted through and can't be fixed. Other signs, such as inadequate or no hot water, generally signal other water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>

When again, that's something you could do yourself, although it's typically better to hire an experienced sink plumber in the San Diego area. Installation involves over a lots actions, and getting rid of the old one includes even more operations.
