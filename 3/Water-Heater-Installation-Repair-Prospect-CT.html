<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
