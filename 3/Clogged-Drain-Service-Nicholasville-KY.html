Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.

When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place.
