<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise till the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
