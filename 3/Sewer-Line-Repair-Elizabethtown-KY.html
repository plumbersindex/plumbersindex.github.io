Claims may be rejected since the standard HO-3 house owners' policy particularly leaves out "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged amount of time." Call your insurance coverage agent and confirm your coverage. Once you have actually read through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered, check with your representative to confirm that your understanding is appropriate.</p>
