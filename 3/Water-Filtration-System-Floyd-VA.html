If a toilet frequently clogs, constantly runs when not in usage, leakages, or does not have flushing power, Master Plumbing & Mechanical can get it back performing at maximum performance.

In some cases, the design or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can become an experimental process. Even professional plumbers often attempt two or 3 flappers before they find one that works well.</p>

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Given that I love to prepare, I generate a whole lot of dishes.
