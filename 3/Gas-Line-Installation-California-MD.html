Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home (developed pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly.
