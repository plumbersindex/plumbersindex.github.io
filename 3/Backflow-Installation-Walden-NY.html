<p>Even if all appears well with your hot water heater, it's a great idea to schedule hot water heater service from time to time just to ensure that everything is kosher. Sediment buildup is a typical problem with hot water heater New Orleans, especially in older units. Gradually, calcium, limescale, and magnesium can gather on the sides of the tank and around the burner. These minerals need to be filtered out of the unit so they do not create a sediment barrier on the burner and interfere with water heater performance. Water heater filtration can flush out these minerals and prevent a malfunction. The burner needs to also be inspected periodically to make sure that the flame is blue with a yellow tip. If the flame is yellow-orange, it will impact your water heater's performance, and it could release carbon monoxide fumes into your indoor air.</p>
