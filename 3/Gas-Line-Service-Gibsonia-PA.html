If you are ready to buy a brand name brand-new hot water heater for the very first time, or if you  wish to replace an old, ineffective model, just offer us a call.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
