<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately constant, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily saved for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
