It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
