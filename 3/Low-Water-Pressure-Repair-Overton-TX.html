<p>Once the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly.
