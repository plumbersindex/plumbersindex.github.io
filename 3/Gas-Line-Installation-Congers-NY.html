<h3>Sewer Repair in Congers New York</h2>
<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it should be restored (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
