<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a waste disposal unit is just equipped to handle softer natural waste. If bones or other tough foods get stuck in the disposal, it might cause it to jam and not work properly. By running hot water through the disposal, you might have the ability to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
