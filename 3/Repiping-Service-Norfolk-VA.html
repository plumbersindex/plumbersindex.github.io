<p>Leaks are sneaky. While the time needed will differ based upon your house size and the number of found breakdowns, it's best to set aside approximately 2 hours when you arrange an inspection. There's constantly the chance that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the starting time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the task (unless you have an extremely little plumbing system). When you contact us to schedule your appointment, ask the length of time the inspection typically takes.</p>
