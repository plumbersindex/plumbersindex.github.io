<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high risk" facilities.</p>

This is an excellent indication that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and for that reason, need to be changed. Remember that if the rust-colored water just features hot water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
