<p>Replacing the ring that seals the connection between the bowl and the sewer line suggests entirely removing the whole toilet. So it's a. great time to think about getting a brand brand-new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>

<p>In some cases called an auger, this helpful tool can clear blockages that might be stuck even more down the system.

This is where you insert the snake into the pipe till you feel resistance to break up the clog.
