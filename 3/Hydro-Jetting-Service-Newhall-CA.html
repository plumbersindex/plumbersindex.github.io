<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished brine solution after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose securely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain tubes need to have an air space.

<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to obstructions that come from inside the home.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
