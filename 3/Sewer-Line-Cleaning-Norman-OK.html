<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

There are various faucet designs, so you might not have the ability to tell what to replace till you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or hire a plumber, this would be a good time to think about whether you wish to update the faucet with a brand-new design.</p>
