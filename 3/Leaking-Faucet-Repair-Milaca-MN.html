<p>Unless your bathroom remodelling is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might effectively belong to your project requirements. Water goes into the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has an unfavorable charge, which brings in the favorably charged minerals in the water (a process known as, ion exchange).

<p>An air pressure test is needed. The test pressure will be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, but no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test duration will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall withstand the test pressure defined without showing any evidence of leak or other problems. Mechanical determines used to determine test pressures shall have a range such that the greatest end of the scale is not higher than 5 times the test pressure.
