A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk.

Then eliminate this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can probably hold the unit upside down and shake it out).</p>
