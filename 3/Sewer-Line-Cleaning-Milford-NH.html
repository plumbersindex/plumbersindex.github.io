The AVB can not be installed in an enclosure including air contaminants. If contaminated air goes into the water piping, it can poison the potable water supply.</p>
<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily stored for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
