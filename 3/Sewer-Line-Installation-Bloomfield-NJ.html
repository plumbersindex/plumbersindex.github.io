We've already seen what these two terms have in common, so what's the distinction in between them? When it comes to the concern of difficult water, a conventional water softener in fact gets rid of calcium, magnesium and silica ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is referred to as short-lived firmness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
