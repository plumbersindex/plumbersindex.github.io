These traps shall consist of a cleanout to grade. Single traps shall be installed, whenever possible, within 5 feet of the beyond outside walls. Some disposals are linked to the dishwasher, which permits self-cleaning. This location frequently struggles with leaks as well. This might be due to a backup of clogged sewage that cant get to the main sewer lines.</p>
