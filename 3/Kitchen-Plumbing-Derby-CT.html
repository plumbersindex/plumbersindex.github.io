<p>There are 2 kinds of disposals: batch feed and continuous feed. A lot of houses utilize continuous feed disposals, which means the disposal will work as long as it is switched on. This comes in handy when a lot of work is to be done in the kitchen. Batch disposals have a holding tank that accumulates waste up until it is full and is then triggered when the cover is closed.

When our organizer understands the style objectives and project specifications, they'll buy the best parts and fixtures for the particular job. Even better? Our component coordinator will manage the logistics and ensure the ideal parts are on-site at the right time.</p>
