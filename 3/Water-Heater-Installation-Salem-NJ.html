<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.

As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about fully regrowed.</p>
