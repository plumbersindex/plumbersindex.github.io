<h3>Reverse Osmosis Systems in Blanchester Ohio</h2>
<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
