<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Replacing potassium chloride for salt chloride might be appropriate if health or ecological reasons require restricting sodium. With time, the beads end up being coated with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regeneration, has three cycles: recharge, backwash and rinse. The regrowth procedure can be scheduled instantly with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
<p>Inadequately installed gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project.

I will recommend SW plumbing for any significant repair.</p>
