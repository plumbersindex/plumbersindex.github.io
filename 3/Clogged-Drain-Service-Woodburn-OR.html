Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

Toilets made prior to the 1980s might use up to 7 gallons of water per flush (GPF.) Many are still on the task and still squandering water. Later models from the 1990s cut GPF in half.</p>
<p>A leaking toilet is another common problem property owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely methods your toilet has a leak. This problem is often brought on by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as basic as a broken flapper valve. A drip pan is reliable and inexpensive. The drip pan is set up under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into a suitable drain. An ideal time to replace or install a drip pan is when the water heater is being replaced.</p>
