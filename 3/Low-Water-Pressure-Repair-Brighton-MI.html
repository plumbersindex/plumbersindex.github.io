<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while liquified solids are captured and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any leftover impurities.</p>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>
