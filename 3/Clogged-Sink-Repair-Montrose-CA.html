<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems.

During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
