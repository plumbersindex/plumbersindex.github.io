That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>
