<p>Backflow preventers not conforming to these rules for an offered application and which are worn or broken and need replacement must be changed by a backflow preventer which does comply to the rules for the provided application.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
