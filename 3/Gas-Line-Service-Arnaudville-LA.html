A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
