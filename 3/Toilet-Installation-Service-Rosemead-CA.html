<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
