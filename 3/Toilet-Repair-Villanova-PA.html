<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Villanova PA?</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many designated uses around your home.</p>
