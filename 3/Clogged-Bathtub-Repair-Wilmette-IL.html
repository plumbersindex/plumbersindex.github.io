Although it's a big task, changing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, utility, or basement  room is relatively straightforward, since the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet needs to be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
