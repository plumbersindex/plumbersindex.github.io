The system needs to grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and enable the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then transition to galvanized. I am uncertain why that should be.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many home centers carry only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
