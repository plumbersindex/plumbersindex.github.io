<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
<p>Slow drains. A sluggish drain can be a common plumbing concern, and many clogs can be fixed with a basic fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. The problem can be a deeper clog someplace in the main sewer line if the basic unclogging approaches don't work to fix the sluggish drain. Unfortunately, mainline clogs are typically much bigger blockages than need more than easy unclogging techniques, however digging into the line itself to access the source of the issue.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention steps must be maintained on-site at all times during construction. Short-term water will be enabled after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker should be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser must be securely attached to tough rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing prior to the structure is substantially complete is prohibited unless a double check backflow assembly is set up and right away tested to guarantee it is working.</p>
