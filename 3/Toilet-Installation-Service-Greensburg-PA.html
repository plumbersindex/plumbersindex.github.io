<p>Leakages are sly. While the time required will differ based on your house size and the variety of found breakdowns, it's best to reserve as much as two hours when you arrange an inspection. There's always the chance that your plumber's previous task will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the task (unless you have a very small plumbing system). When you contact us to arrange your visit, ask for how long the inspection typically takes.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>
