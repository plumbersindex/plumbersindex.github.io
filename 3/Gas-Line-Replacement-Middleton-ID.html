The sewer and drain systems of your home or service, is an integral part of your life. While most people don't provide a second thought, your drains and sewer lines are almost continuously hard at work disposing of your house or company's sewage.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
