<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>

More expensive gas hot water heater with unique venting systems also are readily available. However they're harder to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
