I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
