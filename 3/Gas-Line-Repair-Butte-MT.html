<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the concern if this is the case. You might have to check out using a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This process is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
