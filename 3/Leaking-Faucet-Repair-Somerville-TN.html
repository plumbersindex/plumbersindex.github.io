<p>Look for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>

I will suggest SW plumbing for any significant repair work.</p>

All the materials will restore the interior of your pipes without having to totally replace them. How old is the plumbing in your home? Well, first let's ask you a different concern: How old is your house? If it was built before 1970, it may have pipes made from an out-of-date material that will begin to offer you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not currently). And if your house was developed before World War II, then it almost certainly needs replacements for its old pipes, probably whole-house repiping.</p>

Assemblies not currently noted need to have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
