Garden hoses that are used to apply chemical fertilizers or pesticides are likewise susceptible to drawing impurities into your home. If your home was developed after 1985, it needs to be equipped with backflow-preventing hose bibs. If your house is older, you need to check to make sure you have the proper protection for outdoors faucets.</p>
