<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common.

Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
