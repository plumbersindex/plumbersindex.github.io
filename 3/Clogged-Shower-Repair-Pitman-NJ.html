<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated each year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be tested each year to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
