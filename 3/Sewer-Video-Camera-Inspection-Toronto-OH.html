The test period shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall stand up to the test pressure specified without revealing any proof of leak or other problems. Mechanical gauges utilized to determine test pressures shall have a variety such that the highest end of the scale is not higher than five times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will need a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test could be carried out using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not indicate the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as shown by pressure assesses throughout inspection will be deemed to show the presence of a leak.</p>
