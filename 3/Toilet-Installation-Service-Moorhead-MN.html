<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to escape. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down lead to a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
