<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain Harrodsburg KY</h3>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
