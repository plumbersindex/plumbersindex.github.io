<p>The term tough water describes water with a high mineral content. These minerals can vary depending on which area of the nation you remain in, but many frequently include calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates.

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I love to cook, I produce a whole lot of meals. We established a momentary workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we realized that we needed the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the home within 30 minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for one month. If it obstructs again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!  We are very delighted that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company again and again in the future.</p>
