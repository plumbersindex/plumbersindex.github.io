<p>Close all exterior windows and doors and turn on your kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans. Then open a neighboring warm water faucet up until you hear the gas burner in the water heater spark. After a minute, move a smoking cigarettes match around the edge of the draft hood (Picture 7) on top of the heater. The smoke must be prepared the vent pipe. The fumes from the burner aren't venting if the smoke doesn't draw. Switch off the gas to the hot water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the issue.</p>

Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
