<p>The next step for an ambitious plumbing contractor is to make a contractor's license. Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing service and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers. State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors normally consist of paying an application charge and passing an extensive organisation, law and building code test. Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools supply contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Extra requirements for prospective plumbing company owner may consist of evidence of monetary reliability, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>

<p>An rdc resembles a DC because it is a mechanical backflow preventer including 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves. However, it typically does not include shutoff valves, might or might not be equipped with test dicks or ports, and is generally less reliable than a DC. An rdc works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but must be used to separate just nonhealth risks and is planned for use just in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
