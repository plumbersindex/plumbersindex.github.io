<p>The majority of toilets used today run with a standard gravity flushing design, implying they use the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewer system. Just recently, however, toilets utilizing a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in increasingly more houses.

Softening your water down to the optimum level of 6 grains of hardness is ideal for household use due to the fact that the water remains less corrosive than over-softened water and is without scale producing firmness. Solid Obstructions: Professional help is the best solution, if you find yourself provided with a particularly persistent clog. You may wind up doing more harm than great if you continue to fight with it, which can develop long-term problems.

An entire house water softener is the solution to the scourge of water firmness.</p>
