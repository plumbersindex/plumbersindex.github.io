<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
