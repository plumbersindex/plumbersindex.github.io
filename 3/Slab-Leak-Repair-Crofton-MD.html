<p>Trying to find professional Albuquerque garbage disposal installation and repair services? Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
