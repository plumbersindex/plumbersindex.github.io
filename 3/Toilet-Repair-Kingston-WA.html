<p>It is not always due to clogs that stem inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their method inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems.

<p>A normal water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell. From new bathroom components to custom counter tops, we truly have all of it. Our inventory makes us the very best plumbing company for any job in Seattle, WA. Whatever your need may be, Aurora Plumbing is here.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>

<p>The term hard water" may sound like an oxymoron, however it's just household water which contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. These minerals don't make water unhealthy to drink. They also are relatively undetected through smell or taste, however they can be harmful just the same. Just like our trenchless services, we will initially carry out pipe leak tests utilizing video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
