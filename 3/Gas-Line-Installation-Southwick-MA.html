Water solidity is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
