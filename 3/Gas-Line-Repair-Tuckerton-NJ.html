<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an occurrence such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure once again surpasses the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
