Out of balance or low water pressure is typically a result of rusted metal pipes. When deterioration collects within your pipes, water output for showers, sinks, and other components is significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Your sewer line problem can result in sewer backups, and they usually occur in the lowest open drain. This kind of issue is generally the result of a blockage in the line.
