<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" facilities.</p>
