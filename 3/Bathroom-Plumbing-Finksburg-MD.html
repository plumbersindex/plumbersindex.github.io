<p>Lubrication might assist with the positioning of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any much better, it is just there to help the service technician put together the elements into the body without producing damage from friction. The lube needs to be a food grade lube to guarantee the water supply is not infected. In many cases the best lubricant is water.
