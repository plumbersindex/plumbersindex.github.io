<p>A freshly set up hot water heater should not produce strange noises, however it will begin to create rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater runs to warm the water. Things get worse dramatically for households with a high demand for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be essential.</p>
