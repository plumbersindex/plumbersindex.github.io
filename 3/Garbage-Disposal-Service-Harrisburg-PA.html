<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario.

If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force.

That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>

Assemblies not presently noted should have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
