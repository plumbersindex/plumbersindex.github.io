In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while liquified solids are caught and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning parts: If you have an electrical water heater, a faulty thermostat or a tripped breaker can cause problems.
