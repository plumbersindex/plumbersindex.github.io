<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite instructions from its regular flow. IRWD's drinkable water system is created to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "regular," the instructions of water circulation can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the capacity for polluted water going into the drinkable water distribution system. Copper is a biostatic material, which implies germs will not grow on it.
