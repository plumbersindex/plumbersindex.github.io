Sediment accumulation is a common issue with water heaters New Orleans, specifically in older systems. With time, magnesium, calcium, and limescale can collect on the sides of the tank and around the burner. These minerals should be filtered out of the system so they do not produce a sediment barrier on the burner and interrupt water heater performance.

If the flame is yellow-orange, it will impact your hot water heater's efficiency, and it might release carbon monoxide fumes into your indoor air.</p>
