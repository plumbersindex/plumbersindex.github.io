The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if required, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow.

<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Ontario OR</h3>
