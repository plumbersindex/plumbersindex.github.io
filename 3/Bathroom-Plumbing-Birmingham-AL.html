<p>The water quality improvement market has actually earnestly sought to sort out the accurate info on water softener system effluent.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
