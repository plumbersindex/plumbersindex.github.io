<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
