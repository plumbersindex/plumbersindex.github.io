The paired check valves are organized in line with the pipeline and run independently of each other. A set of four test cocks allow the operator to examine the valves and make certain they are not being forced open by built up debris. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to allow water at awaited functional pressure to stream through. Should backflow occur, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, avoiding the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
