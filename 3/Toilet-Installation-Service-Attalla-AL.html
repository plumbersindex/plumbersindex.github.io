<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>

These minerals can vary depending upon which area of the nation you remain in, however most commonly include calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates.

<p>If your polybutylene pipes have stopped working, read your insurance coverage thoroughly. Make certain you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurer will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be denied because the standard HO-3 property owners' policy particularly omits "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over an extended time period."
