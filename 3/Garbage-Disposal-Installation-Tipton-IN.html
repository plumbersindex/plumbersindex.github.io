While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
