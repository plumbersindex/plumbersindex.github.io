<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.

<p>Regenerate your softener with potassium chloride rather of salt chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is available at many stores that sell softener salt. Because the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space. Clogged obstruction and drainage problems may begin as minor problems but can quickly speed up into considerable problems. A clogged drain can even result in sluggish water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and costly repairs.</p>
<p>To lower the need of gas line repair, it is necessary to understand the typical reasons for gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances occur most commonly in the winter. This is because homes are not properly ventilated throughout the cooler months to avoid heat loss. We suggest setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to inform you of any possible gas leaks if you haven't done so currently.</p>
