<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regenerated, the beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, difficult water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these symptoms.</p>

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to assist avoid leaks and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl.

Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
