<p>A PVB must be installed 12 inches above the greatest emission point. The advantage of this device is that you can install multiple zone valves in valve boxes underground after the device. However, if there are a number of leaks within the system, or if there is proof of corrosion in a number of places, it is most likely time to repipe.
