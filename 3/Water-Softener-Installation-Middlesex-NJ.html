<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
