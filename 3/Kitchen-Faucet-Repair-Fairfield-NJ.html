<p>If you or anyone in the structure begins to experience the above noted signs, bear in mind of the location. If signs afflict individuals in a particular location then it may be a gas leak.

How frequently a toilet clogs depends upon the strength of its flush, the cleanliness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush.

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that should also be well maintained to help prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to break and harden or just be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
