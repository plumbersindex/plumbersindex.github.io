<p>If you spot a leak and choose a patching job rather of a repiping task, simply bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the very same material and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to consider repiping your whole home when you find a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
