Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange.

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Chillicothe OH</h3>
<p>The most common bathroom sink plumbing problem homeowners face is a clogged drain, from the accumulation of hair, soap scum, and even foreign things like bobby pins or cotton swabs. If you have a clogged sink in your bathroom, you can try to unclog it the sink yourself utilizing a sink plunger. Call the professional plumbers at Roto-Rooter if the clog is too far down the pipes or you can't fix it on your own. Our specialists will fix your clogged drains and offer additional sink repair if needed.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
