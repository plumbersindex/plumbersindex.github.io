<p>Leakages are tricky. While the time required will vary based upon the house size and the number of found malfunctions, it's best to set aside up to two hours when you arrange an inspection. There's constantly the possibility that your plumber's previous task will run long and delay the beginning time.

Ask how long the inspection typically takes when you call to schedule your appointment.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
