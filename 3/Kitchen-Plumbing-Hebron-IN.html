<p>In this situation, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Double flush valves are becoming a growing number of common, as both manufacturers and consumers seek new methods to conserve water. Dual flush toilets enable the user to pick the level of water needed to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is liquid or solid. We have actually all heard the old saying, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, lots of people find that squicky - and so the dual flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're simply using less water to do it.</p>

<p>You reside in an older house. There's a good opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
