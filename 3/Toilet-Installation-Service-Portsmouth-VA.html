<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to gain access to in-wall pipes, consider at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, changing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or utility  room is relatively straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets should definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
