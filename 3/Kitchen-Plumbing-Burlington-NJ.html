<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Burlington NJ</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream in reverse into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these occasions.</p>
