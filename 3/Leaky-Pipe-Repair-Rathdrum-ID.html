<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes.

The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high threat" facilities.</p>
