<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily saved for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
