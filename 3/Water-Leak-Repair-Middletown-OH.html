Pressure-assisted toilets harness pressure from the water system in the home to develop an effective "push-through" flush. All waste is removed quickly in about four seconds. Pressure assisted toilets are a little louder and there is no condensation or "sweating" on the outer tank.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
