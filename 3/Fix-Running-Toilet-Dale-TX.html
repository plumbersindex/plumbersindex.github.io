<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
