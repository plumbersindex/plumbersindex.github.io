<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
