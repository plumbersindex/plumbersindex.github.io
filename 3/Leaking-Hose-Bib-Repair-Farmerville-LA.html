<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high danger" establishments.</p>

If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
