<p>We aren't here to sway you in one instructions or the other - we install both gas and electric water heaters - however we wish to inform you on the advantages and drawbacks of both so you can make the choice that best fits you. This is especially common after returning from a vacation or not utilizing your home's supply of water for an extended time period. It may be due to a rusty hot water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your home if this occurs only when your hot water is running.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbers will be out to you in no time, and we will have your clogged drain fixed in brief order.

We had a terrific experience with Joe Boyette, he was extremely professional, courteous, qualified. We had a lot of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration. We also had to replace a water and a bathroom heater unassociated to the fire, but we felt great in Joe's abilities. We decided to stick with Joe, although we felt Mr Rooter rates were absolutely on the high-end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
