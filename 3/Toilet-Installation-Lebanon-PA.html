<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>

<p>Your sewer line issue can lead to sewer backups, and they usually take place in the lowest open drain. This kind of issue is normally the outcome of a blockage in the line. If you do not discover the odor coming from the sewer backup, you might determine this problem due to the fact that a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your home is dependent upon the main sewer line for appropriate drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's a separated concern with only that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
