<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
