<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>Where the company lies: Beware of contractors who give you a post workplace box with no street address or usage only an answering service. If he or she pressures you to employ fast and pay money up front, never ever work with someone who comes unsolicited to your door and can't offer you proof of qualifications-- especially. Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of completion user. The # 2 Examine prevents backflow brought on by pressure boosts in the down stream plumbing.</p>
