It usually symbolizes rust and mineral buildup if you notice low water pressure or stained water. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water supply, impacting the water quality.

<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
