<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario.
