Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
