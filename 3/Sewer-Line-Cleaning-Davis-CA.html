<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions.

<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
