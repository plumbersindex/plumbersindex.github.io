The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement.

Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to escape. Sometimes no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
