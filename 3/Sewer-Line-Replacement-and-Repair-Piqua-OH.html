<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
