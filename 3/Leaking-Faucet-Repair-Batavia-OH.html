A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater. To guarantee that we are providing top quality work and client comfort, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to safely carry out hot water heater replacements.
