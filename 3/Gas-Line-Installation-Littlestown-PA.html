The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

The majority of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas water heaters with unique venting systems likewise are available. But they're harder to install, and we will not handle them here.</p>
