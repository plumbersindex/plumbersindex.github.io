Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things differently might have saved her a lot of money. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure.

For this factor, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
<p>On average nationwide, it costs between $120 and $150 to install a waste disposal unit.
