It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle successfully halves the interior size of the tee. When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly true.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
