If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety preventative measures you should take to safeguard yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
