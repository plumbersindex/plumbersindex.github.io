During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
