<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>There are 2 popular install systems used for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt install (if you've had actually a disposer installed for a long time, it's most likely installed by doing this) and a newer system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock"). Each accomplish the same job with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name indicates, the EZ Mount system is meant to be simpler to handle when installing or fixing an unit.</p>
