If pressing down on the flapper stops the sound, the flapper isn't sealing under typical pressure. Turn off the water, flush the toilet to empty the tank and after that run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat. Clean the flush valve seat with an abrasive sponge or ScotchBrite pad if you feel mineral deposits. Don't use anything that might roughen it. You need to replace the flapper if cleaning the flush valve seat does not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>If you start to discover lower water pressure in your sink or shower, this could be a sign of rust and mineral accumulation which will gradually begin to obstruct the flow of water through your pipes. For accumulation to affect your water pressure like this, it implies that it has been building up for several years so you need to look into getting a plumbing inspection immediately to guarantee your pipes haven't triggered any substantial damage, and intend on replacing your piping sometime quickly.</p>
