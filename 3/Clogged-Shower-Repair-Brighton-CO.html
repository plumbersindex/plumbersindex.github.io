<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to get away.
