<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. Due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system.

One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
