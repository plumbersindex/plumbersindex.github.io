The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to escape.
