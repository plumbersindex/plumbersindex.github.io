<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
