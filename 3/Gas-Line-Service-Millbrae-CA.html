<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.
