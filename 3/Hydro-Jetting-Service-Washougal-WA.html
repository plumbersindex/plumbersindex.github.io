<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
