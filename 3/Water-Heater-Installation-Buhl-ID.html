It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect versus back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
