<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
